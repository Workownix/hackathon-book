## Prompt

Create governing principles for an AI-native educational textbook project focused on:
1. Content Quality - Technical accuracy, clear explanations suitable for learners, comprehensive code examples with explanations, consistent terminology across modules
2. Code Standards - Clean, well-documented code examples, security best practices (no hardcoded secrets), error handling in all examples, TypeScript/Python type safety
3. Testing Requirements - All code examples must be tested and working, RAG chatbot responses must be validated, authentication flows must be secure, content generation must be reproducible
4. User Experience - Fast page load times (< 3s), responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop, accessible content (WCAG 2.1 AA), intuitive navigation between modules, seamless chatbot integration
5. Performance Standards - Build time < 2 minutes, API response time < 500ms, chatbot queries < 3 seconds, support 100+ concurrent users
6. AI Integration - Prompt engineering best practices, RAG accuracy > 85%, personalization respects user privacy, translation maintains technical accuracy

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive constitution v1.0.0 with 6 core principles:

I. Content Quality (NON-NEGOTIABLE) - Technical accuracy, clarity, consistent terminology
II. Code Standards - Clean code, security, type safety, comprehensive documentation
III. Testing Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE) - All examples tested, RAG validated, security-tested auth
IV. User Experience - <3s load times, responsive, accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA), intuitive navigation
V. AI Integration - >85% RAG accuracy, privacy-respecting, ethical AI use, source citations
VI. Performance Standards - <2min builds, <500ms API, <3s chatbot, 100+ concurrent users

Additional sections:
- Development Workflow with quality gates
- Security Requirements (authentication, encryption, rate limiting)
- Governance with amendment process and compliance verification

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established project-wide governing principles and quality standards
- 🧪 Tests: None (documentation)
- 📁 Files: Created .specify/memory/constitution.md (v1.0.0)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.specify to create feature specification
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution provides clear, measurable standards for educational content quality, code quality, testing, UX, performance, and AI integration. All principles are NON-NEGOTIABLE or have clear rationale.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All placeholders filled, principles are clear and testable
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A (initial version)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Monitor constitution compliance during feature development
